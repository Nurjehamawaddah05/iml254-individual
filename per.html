  <b><span style="color:#331a00;font-size:35px">Travelling-Exploration:</span></b>
    I have a passion for exploring places, whether independently or in a group. I believe that every exploration allows me to gain valuable knowledge. I got to learn       about the culture,  different environments, and get close to the nature of the place. For now, I have been traveling to several states in Malaysia such as Kuala        Lumpur, Terengganu, and Johor. Each state has its background and uniqueness that brought Malaysia to become a developed country.

  <b><span style="color:#331a00;font-size:35px">Reading-Theraphy:</span></b>
    Reading is another deep passion that I gradually realized I am fond of. I have read different types of books written by inspiring authors, including J.K. Rowling,      Priscilla Caplan, and Stephen King. I tend to explore various types of genres, especially scientific and technological inventions. Reading habits bring a lot of        new revelations that tickle my brain as well as change how I see the world's operations. Reading exploration enables people to acknowledge their interests and over     time reading will become one of the fond therapy.

  <b><span style="color:#331a00;font-size:35px">Participation-Volunteering-Active:</span></b>
    Participation in activities became my other passion which I found really fun and enjoyable. I have been participating in many events at every level including     middle school, high school, and university. Events like National-level conferences, library community , and grab knowledge events are examples of events that I     enjoyed the most. This participation helps me to move out of my comfort zone and search for the better zone.
